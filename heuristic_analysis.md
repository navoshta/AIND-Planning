## Results

Having evaluated 5 search algorithms (3 uninformed and 2 using A* search with different heuristics) on 3 problems of different complexity we can see emerging patterns of each of the algorithm performance. 

Depth first search is the only one that didn't find an optimal solution, which is not surprising as it simply traverses the tree in the depth-first order, returning the first solution found. This is also why it was the first to return a solution on all three problems. As it failed to find an optimal solution we will not consider it in our further evaluations.

When it comes uninformed vs informed search algorithms, informed ones seem to perform better or at least just as good on all three problems. Informed search algorithms were represented by A* search using two differen heuristics, and their performance is either on par or better on all three problems than any uninformed algorithms evaluated here â€” both when it comes to speed and exploration costs (depending on what you're after).

Although informed search algorithms perform better overal, their performance highly depends on the heuristic function we choose, as Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig hightlight in their "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" textbook. We can see that here as well, as A* search performance varies significantly depending on one of the two heuristics we use: if we use heuristic ignoring preconditions we find an optimal solution about one order of magnitude faster than with the one calculating levels costs. However `levelsum` heuristic requires roughly an order of magnitude less in terms of exploration costs: number of node expansions, goal tests and nodes additions.

To summarise, informed search algorithms will perform better than uninformed ones with a carefully chosen heuristic. The choice of heuristic however highly depends on the problem domain and requried speed/memory tradeoff: if graph exploration costs are relatively high, it would make sense to use a `levelsum` heuristic; and if speed is way more of a factor, then a heuristic which is ignoring preconditions will be a much better fit.
